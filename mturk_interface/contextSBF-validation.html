            <p>
              At the University of Washington, we're passionate about understanding how potentially toxic or disrespectful language or stereotypes can be used against certain demographics/groups of people (e.g. racism, sexism, etc.).
              Although there is no direct benefit to you for participating, we very much appreciate your help in identifying and explaining such language/stereotypes, since this is something computational models have no clue about.
              We do not agree with any of the content/stereotypes presented to you, but it's important that we gather these annotations for research purposes.
            </p>

              <strong>Data collection &amp; sharing</strong><br>
              We will not ask you for your name, and the data collected in this study will be made unidentifiable to the best of our extent.
              We will securely store the data on our servers and only share with qualified researchers (e.g. who want to further the study of hate speech detection).
              If you later decide that you do not want your responses included in this study, please email so we can exclude your work.
              <br>
