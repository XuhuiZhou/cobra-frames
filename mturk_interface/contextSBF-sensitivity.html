    <p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em>: This research study aims to <strong>understand how toxicity, hate, and social biases appear in language</strong>. You will <strong>read a potentially toxic or biased statement, two different contexts and some explanations</strong> of what it means, and <strong>rate the explanations</strong>. This should take 1-3 minutes.</p>

    <p><em>Background:</em> Here at CMU, we are passionate about understanding how potentially toxic or disrespectful language or stereotypes can be used against certain demographics/groups of people (e.g. racism, sexism, etc.). Although there is no direct benefit to you for participating, we very much appreciate your help in identifying and explaining such language/stereotypes, since this is something computational AI systems have no clue about.</p>

    <p><em>Content warning</em>: Due to the nature of this study, you will encounter biased, offensive, or upsetting content. While it&#39;s crucial for us to annotate them, we do not endorse any of the stereotypes or offensive/immoral/rude material. If you have strong negative reactions to some of the content, please reach out <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">to Crisis Text Line</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Participation</em>: You must be at least 18 years old. Participation is voluntary. You may discontinue participation at any time during the research activity. You may print a copy of this consent form for your records.</p>

    <p><em>Data collection &amp; sharing</em>: We will not ask you for your name, and the data collected in this study will be made unidentifiable to the best of our extent. We will securely store the data on our servers and only share with qualified researchers (e.g., who want to further the study of hate speech detection). If you later decide that you do not want your responses included in this study, please email so we can exclude your work.</p>

    <p><em>Contact</em>: If you have any questions about this study, you should feel free to ask them by contacting us (via the MTurk interface or via email at maartensap@cmu.edu). If you have questions later, desire additional information, or wish to withdraw your participation please contact Maarten Sap via e-mail in accordance with the contact information listed above.
